### Mastering Parametrization in Martini 3: Tips and Tricks for Small Molecules and Lipids

This repository contains two tutorials designed for the **Advances in Molecular Modeling Workshop** hosted at the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen. 
These sessions will be held on:

**Date:** December 9â€“10, 2024  
**Location:** Auditorium A (Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen)

## Workshop Session Details
**Title:** Workshop: Mastering Parametrization in Martini 3: Tips and Tricks for Small Molecules and Lipids  
**Speaker:** Dr. Paulo Cesar Telles de Souza (ENS de Lyon, CNRS, France)

## Tutorials Overview
These tutorials will guide participants through advanced Martini 3 parametrization techniques, focusing on:

1. **[Tutorial 1](Tutorial_1): Parametrization of small molecules** (Adapted from [here](https://cgmartini.nl/docs/tutorials/Martini3/Small_Molecule_Parametrization/))
   - Generate atomistic reference data;
   - Atom-to-bead mapping;
   - Generate target CG distributions from the CG mapped trajectory;
   - Optimize CG bonded parameters.
     
2. **[Tutorial 2](Tutorial_2): Complex lipid mixtures and assembling a lipid from known fragments** (Adapted from [here](https://cgmartini.nl/docs/tutorials/Martini3/LipidsII/#analysis-hexagonality))
   - Buiding membranes;
   - Simulating complex lipid mixtures;
   - Designing a New Lipid Based on a Small Fragment.
